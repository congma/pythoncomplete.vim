Function completion for Sub Classes

Example

class Foo(object):

    def spondonicle(self,somearg,someotherarg):
        pass

class SubFoo(Foo):

    def wibble(self,anotherarg,foo=None):
        pass

    def s<c-x><c-o> <!-- shou;d complete spondonicle here

class SubSubFoo(SubFoo):

    def spondonicle(self,somearg,someotherarg):
        pass

    def w<c-x><c-o> should show wibble here


Sys Path Import completion

from datetime import ti<c-x><c-o> <--- should import timedelta here


BUGS: 

This is a work in progress. There needs to be a lot of filtering out of irrelevant arguments.

Some modules will complain on a dir() function

Doc strings need to be filtered
